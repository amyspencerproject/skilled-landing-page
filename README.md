## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I have only used pseudo elements once before this project. Typing "pseudo" alone into a search is not spefic enough. I needed to use pseudo elements specifically and it took me a little bit to realize this. I needed a ::before to get course icons to sit just halfway above the top of the card.
